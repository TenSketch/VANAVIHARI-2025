# Reservation Form - Dynamic Dropdowns Implementation

## Overview
Updated the Add Reservation form to dynamically load resorts, cottage types, and rooms based on user selections.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dynamic Data Flow
- **Resort Dropdown**: Loads all resorts from the backend on component mount
- **Cottage Type Dropdown**: Loads cottage types filtered by selected resort
- **Room Dropdown**: Loads rooms filtered by selected cottage type

### 2. Key Features
- **Cascading Selections**: When a parent dropdown changes, child dropdowns reset
  - Selecting a new resort clears cottage type and room
  - Selecting a new cottage type clears room
- **Loading States**: Shows "Loading..." while fetching data
- **Disabled States**: Child dropdowns are disabled until parent is selected
- **Empty States**: Shows appropriate messages when no data is available

### 3. API Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/resorts` - Fetch all resorts
- `GET /api/cottage-types` - Fetch all cottage types (filtered client-side by resort)
- `GET /api/rooms` - Fetch all rooms (filtered client-side by cottage type)

### 4. Data Filtering
The form filters data on the client side:
- Cottage types are filtered by matching `cottageType.resort === selectedResortId`
- Rooms are filtered by matching `room.cottageType === selectedCottageTypeId`

### 5. Form Reset
The reset button now properly clears all form data and resets the dynamic dropdowns without reloading the page.

## Technical Details

### State Management
```typescript
const [resorts, setResorts] = useState<Resort[]>([]);
const [cottageTypes, setCottageTypes] = useState<CottageType[]>([]);
const [rooms, setRooms] = useState<Room[]>([]);
const [loading, setLoading] = useState({
  resorts: false,
  cottageTypes: false,
  rooms: false,
});
```

### Cascading Logic
```typescript
const handleSelect = (name: string, value: string) => {
  if (name === "resort") {
    setFormData({ ...formData, resort: value, cottageType: "", room: "" });
  } else if (name === "cottageType") {
    setFormData({ ...formData, cottageType: value, room: "" });
  } else {
    setFormData({ ...formData, [name]: value });
  }
};
```

## User Experience
1. User opens the form → Resorts load automatically
2. User selects a resort → Cottage types for that resort appear
3. User selects a cottage type → Rooms for that cottage type appear
4. User can now complete the reservation with the selected room

## Future Enhancements
- Add server-side filtering with query parameters to reduce data transfer
- Implement caching to avoid refetching data
- Add room availability checking based on check-in/check-out dates
- Show room pricing when a room is selected
