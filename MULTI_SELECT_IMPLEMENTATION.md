# Multi-Select Implementation for Reservation Form

## Overview
Updated the Add Reservation form to support multiple cottage type and room selections using a custom multi-select component.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Components Created

#### `admin/src/components/ui/multi-select.tsx`
- Custom multi-select component with badge display
- Supports selecting multiple items from a dropdown
- Shows selected items as removable badges
- Includes search functionality

#### `admin/src/components/ui/command.tsx`
- Command palette component for searchable lists
- Used by multi-select for filtering options

#### `admin/src/components/ui/popover.tsx`
- Popover component using Radix UI
- Provides the dropdown container for multi-select

### 2. Form Data Structure Changes

**Before:**
```typescript
{
  cottageType: "",  // Single string
  room: "",         // Single string
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
{
  cottageTypes: [],  // Array of strings
  rooms: [],         // Array of strings
}
```

### 3. Multi-Select Behavior

#### Cottage Types
- User can select multiple cottage types after choosing a resort
- Selected cottage types appear as removable badges
- Click the X on a badge to remove it

#### Rooms
- Rooms are filtered based on ALL selected cottage types
- If you select "Deluxe" and "Premium" cottage types, you'll see rooms from both
- User can select multiple rooms
- Selected rooms appear as removable badges

### 4. Cascading Logic
- Selecting a resort → Clears cottage types and rooms
- Changing cottage types → Clears rooms
- Rooms are filtered to show only those matching the selected cottage types

### 5. UI Features
- **Search**: Type to filter options in the dropdown
- **Badges**: Selected items shown as removable badges
- **Disabled States**: Dropdowns disabled until parent selection is made
- **Loading States**: Shows "Loading..." while fetching data
- **Empty States**: Shows helpful messages when no data available

## User Flow

1. **Select Resort** → Single selection (unchanged)
2. **Select Cottage Types** → Multi-select
   - Click to open dropdown
   - Click items to select/deselect
   - Selected items appear as badges
   - Click X on badge to remove
3. **Select Rooms** → Multi-select
   - Shows rooms from all selected cottage types
   - Same multi-select behavior as cottage types

## Technical Details

### Multi-Select Handler
```typescript
const handleMultiSelect = (name: string, values: string[]) => {
  if (name === "cottageTypes") {
    setFormData({ ...formData, cottageTypes: values, rooms: [] });
  } else if (name === "rooms") {
    setFormData({ ...formData, rooms: values });
  }
};
```

### Room Filtering
```typescript
const filtered = data.rooms.filter((room: Room) => {
  const cottageTypeId = typeof room.cottageType === 'string' 
    ? room.cottageType 
    : room.cottageType?._id;
  return formData.cottageTypes.includes(cottageTypeId);
});
```

## Dependencies
- `@radix-ui/react-popover` - For popover functionality
- Existing UI components: Badge, Button, Input, Label

## Backend Compatibility
The form now sends arrays for `cottageTypes` and `rooms` fields. You may need to update the backend controller to handle these as arrays if you want to save multiple selections.

## Future Enhancements
- Add "Select All" / "Clear All" buttons
- Show count of selected items in the trigger
- Add room availability indicators
- Group rooms by cottage type in the dropdown
