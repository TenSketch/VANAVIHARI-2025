- [ ] Payment fails (Test Bank → Failure)
- [ ] Callback received
- [ ] Reservation cancelled
- [ ] User redirected to failure page
- [ ] Room released

### Scenario 3: User Cancellation
- [ ] User fills booking form
- [ ] Pre-reservation created
- [ ] Payment initiated
- [ ] User redirected to BillDesk
- [ ] User clicks Cancel
- [ ] Callback received

## 🐛 Known Issues / Edge Cases

### Issue 1: Pre-Reservation Expiry
**Problem:** Pre-reservations don't auto-cancel after 15 mins  
**Impact:** Rooms stay blocked unnecessarily  
**Solution:** Implement cron job to check and cancel expired pre-reservations  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Pending

### Issue 2: Duplicate Callbacks
**Problem:** BillDesk might send callback multiple times  
**Impact:** Could cause duplicate processing  
**Solution:** Add idempotency check (check if already processed)  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** Pending

### Issue 3: User Closes Browser
**Problem:** If user closes browser during payment, callback might be missed  
**Impact:** Payment successful but reservation not updated  
**Solution:** Implement webhook handler (async updates)  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Pending

### Issue 4: Pending Payments
**Problem:** No automatic verification of pending payments  
**Impact:** User doesn't know final status  
**Solution:** Implement verify transaction API + cron job  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Pending

### Issue 5: Email Notifications
**Problem:** No email sent to users  
**Impact:** Poor user experience  
**Solution:** Implement email service  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Pending (placeholder added)
