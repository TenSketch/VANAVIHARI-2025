# Transaction Polling System - Complete Implementation

## ✅ Status: WORKING!

The transaction polling system is now fully functional and automatically updates reservation status based on payment results.

## How It Works

### 1. Payment Initiation
When a user initiates payment:
- Order created with BillDesk
- Reservation set to `status: 'pending'`, `paymentStatus: 'unpaid'`
- Expiry set to 15 minutes from now
- **Polling starts immediately**

### 2. Automatic Polling (Every 5 Minutes)
The system checks transaction status:
- **Check #1**: Immediately after payment initiation
- **Check #2**: 5 minutes later
- **Check #3**: 10 minutes later
- **Auto-stops**: After 15 minutes or when payment confirmed

### 3. Status Detection & Updates

#### ✅ Payment Successful (`auth_status: '0300'`)
```javascript
Reservation:
  status: 'reserved'
  paymentStatus: 'paid'
  expiresAt: null (cleared)
  rawSource.transactionId: "U1239EY0024B2B"
  rawSource.authStatus: "0300"

PaymentTransaction:
  status: 'success'
  transactionId: "U1239EY0024B2B"
  authStatus: "0300"

Actions:
  ✅ Stop polling
  📧 Send confirmation emails (user + admin)
```

#### ❌ Payment Failed (`auth_status: '0399'`)
```javascript
Reservation:
  status: 'cancelled'
  paymentStatus: 'failed'
  rawSource.paymentError: "Payment processing error"

PaymentTransaction:
  status: 'failed'
  errorMessage: "Payment processing error"

Actions:
  ✅ Stop polling
```

#### 🚫 User Cancelled (`auth_status: '0398'`)
```javascript
Reservation:
  status: 'cancelled'
  paymentStatus: 'cancelled'

PaymentTransaction:
  status: 'cancelled'

Actions:
  ✅ Stop polling
```

#### ⏳ Payment Pending (`auth_status: '0002'`)
```javascript
Actions:
  ⏳ Continue polling
  ⏰ Check again in 5 minutes
```

## Transaction Response Structure

```json
{
  "objectid": "transaction",
  "transactionid": "U1239EY0024B2B",
  "orderid": "VM0712512512007",
  "mercid": "BDUAT2K673",
  "transaction_date": "2025-12-07T18:22:12+05:30",
  "amount": "6000.00",
  "surcharge": "0.00",
  "discount": "0.00",
  "charge_amount": "6000.00",
  "currency": "356",
  "auth_status": "0399",
  "transaction_error_code": "TRPPE0001",
  "transaction_error_desc": "Payment processing error",
  "transaction_error_type": "payment_processing_error",
  "payment_method_type": "netbanking",
  "payment_category": "01",
  "txn_process_type": "nb",
  "bankid": "123"
}
```

## Auth Status Codes

| Code | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| `0300` | Success | Update to reserved/paid, stop polling, send emails |
| `0399` | Failed | Update to cancelled/failed, stop polling |
| `0398` | User Cancelled | Update to cancelled, stop polling |
| `0002` | Pending | Continue polling |
| Other | Unknown | Continue polling |

## Files Involved

### Core Implementation
1. **`backend/services/retrieveTransaction.js`**
   - Makes encrypted API call to BillDesk
   - Retrieves transaction status
   - Decrypts response

2. **`backend/services/transactionPoller.js`**
   - Manages polling intervals
   - Checks status every 5 minutes
   - Updates reservation & payment transaction
   - Stops polling when done

3. **`backend/controllers/paymentController.js`**
   - Starts polling on payment initiation
   - Stops polling on callback
   - Manual retrieve endpoint

### Models
- `backend/models/reservationModel.js`
- `backend/models/paymentTransactionModel.js`

### Routes
- `backend/routes/paymentRoutes.js`

## API Endpoints

### Automatic (Background)
- Polling runs automatically every 5 minutes
- No manual intervention needed

### Manual Check
```http
GET /api/payment/transaction/:bookingId
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

## Example Logs

### Successful Payment Detection
```
📊 Poll Check #2 for booking: VM0712512512007
   Time: 2025-12-07T12:27:12.000Z

## Benefits

1. **Automatic Status Updates**: No manual intervention needed
2. **Handles Delayed Callbacks**: Catches payments even if webhook fails
3. **Better UX**: Users see updated status without refreshing
4. **Audit Trail**: All checks logged for debugging
5. **Resource Efficient**: Only 3 checks per booking, auto-stops
6. **Reliable**: Works even if BillDesk callback fails

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### 1. ✅ Email Notifications (IMPLEMENTED)
Emails are automatically sent when payment is detected as successful:
- User receives booking confirmation with all details
- Admin receives notification of new booking
- Emails sent asynchronously (non-blocking)
- Failure to send emails doesn't affect booking status

### 2. Webhook Fallback
If webhook arrives before polling detects it, stop polling:
```javascript
// In handlePaymentCallback
if (paymentTransaction.status === 'success') {
  stopTransactionPolling(bookingId);
}
```

### 3. Admin Dashboard
Show active polls in admin panel:
```javascript
import { getActivePolls } from './services/transactionPoller.js';
const activeBookings = getActivePolls();
```

### 4. Retry Logic
Add retry for failed API calls:
```javascript
let retries = 0;
while (retries < 3) {
  try {
    const result = await retrieveTransaction(...);
    break;
  } catch (error) {
    retries++;
    await sleep(1000 * retries);
  }
}
```

### 5. Configurable Intervals
Make polling interval configurable:
```javascript
const POLL_INTERVAL_MINUTES = process.env.POLL_INTERVAL || 5;
const MAX_POLLS = process.env.MAX_POLLS || 3;
```

## Testing

### Test Successful Payment
1. Create booking
2. Initiate payment
3. Complete payment in BillDesk
4. Wait for next poll (max 5 mins)
5. Check reservation status → should be 'reserved'/'paid'

### Test Failed Payment
1. Create booking
2. Initiate payment
3. Fail payment in BillDesk
4. Wait for next poll
5. Check reservation status → should be 'cancelled'/'failed'

### Test Pending Payment
1. Create booking
2. Initiate payment
3. Don't complete payment
4. Polling continues for 15 minutes
5. After 15 mins, reservation expires

## Troubleshooting

### Polling Not Starting
- Check logs for "🔄 Starting transaction polling"
- Verify payment initiation completed successfully

### Status Not Updating
- Check logs for "✅ Transaction retrieved successfully"
- Verify auth_status in response
- Check database for updates

### Polling Not Stopping
- Check if auth_status is recognized (0300, 0399, 0398)
- Verify stopTransactionPolling is called
- Check activePolls map

## Monitoring

```javascript
// Check active polls
import { getActivePolls } from './services/transactionPoller.js';
console.log('Active polls:', getActivePolls());

// Stop specific poll
import { stopTransactionPolling } from './services/transactionPoller.js';
stopTransactionPolling('VM0712512512007');
```

## Success Metrics

✅ Transaction retrieval working  
✅ Automatic status detection  
✅ Database updates working  
✅ Polling auto-stops  
✅ Handles all status codes  
✅ Error handling in place  
✅ Logging comprehensive  
✅ Email notifications integrated  

## Conclusion

The transaction polling system is **production-ready** and provides a reliable fallback mechanism for payment status updates, ensuring no bookings are left in limbo even if webhooks fail.
