# Email Notifications - Integrated with Transaction Polling

## ✅ Status: COMPLETE

Email notifications are now fully integrated with the transaction polling system. When a payment is detected as successful, confirmation emails are automatically sent to both the user and admin.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Shared Email Service
**File:** `backend/services/emailService.js`

Extracted the email sending logic into a reusable service that can be used by:
- Payment callback handler
- Transaction polling system
- Any other part of the application

### 2. Updated Transaction Poller
**File:** `backend/services/transactionPoller.js`

Added email sending when payment success is detected:
```javascript
if (authStatus === '0300') {
  // Update database...
  
  // Send confirmation emails
  const updatedReservation = await Reservation.findOne({ bookingId }).lean();
  const updatedPaymentTransaction = await PaymentTransaction.findOne({ bookingId }).lean();
  
  sendReservationSuccessEmails(updatedReservation, updatedPaymentTransaction)
    .then((result) => {
      if (result.success) {
        console.log(`✅ Confirmation emails sent successfully`);
      }
    })
    .catch(err => console.error(`❌ Email sending error: ${err.message}`));
}
```

### 3. Updated Payment Controller
**File:** `backend/controllers/paymentController.js`

Now imports and uses the shared email service instead of having its own copy.

## Email Flow

### When Payment Detected as Successful

1. **Database Updated**
   - Reservation: `status: 'reserved'`, `paymentStatus: 'paid'`
   - PaymentTransaction: `status: 'success'`

2. **Emails Sent Asynchronously**
   - User email: Booking confirmation with all details
   - Admin email: New booking notification

3. **Email Content Includes**
   - Guest details (name, email, phone, address)
   - Booking ID
   - Room list
   - Check-in/out dates
   - Total guests
   - Payment amount
   - Transaction ID
   - Resort details
   - Contact information

## Email Templates

### User Email
- Subject: `Booking Confirmation - {bookingId}`
- Template: `RESERVATION_SUCCESS_EMAIL_TEMPLATE`
- Includes: Full booking details, payment confirmation, resort info

### Admin Email
- Subject: `New Booking - {bookingId} - {resortName}`
- Template: `RESERVATION_SUCCESS_EMAIL_ADMIN_TEMPLATE`
- Includes: Guest details, booking summary, payment info

## Error Handling

- Email sending is **non-blocking** (async)
- Failures are logged but don't affect booking status
- If emails fail, booking is still confirmed in database
- Errors logged with `❌` prefix for easy identification

## Example Logs

### Successful Email Sending
```
💰 Payment successful! Updating reservation to paid/reserved...
✅ Reservation updated to reserved/paid
🔄 Stopped polling for booking: VM0712512512007
📧 Sending confirmation emails...
✅ Confirmation email sent to user: user@example.com
✅ Notification email sent to admin
✅ Confirmation emails sent successfully
```

### Email Failure (Non-Critical)
```
💰 Payment successful! Updating reservation to paid/reserved...
✅ Reservation updated to reserved/paid
🔄 Stopped polling for booking: VM0712512512007
📧 Sending confirmation emails...
❌ Error sending reservation emails: SMTP connection failed
❌ Email sending failed: SMTP connection failed
```
*Note: Booking is still confirmed even if emails fail*

## Testing

### Test Successful Payment with Emails
1. Create a booking
2. Initiate payment
3. Complete payment successfully
4. Wait for polling to detect (max 5 minutes)
5. Check logs for email confirmation
6. Verify user received email
7. Verify admin received email

### Test Email Failure Handling
1. Temporarily misconfigure SMTP settings
2. Create and complete a booking
3. Verify booking is still confirmed in database
4. Check logs for email error messages
5. Restore SMTP settings

## Environment Variables Required

```env
# Email Configuration

## Monitoring

### Check Email Sending

## Future Enhancements

1. **Email Queue**

   - Use Twilio or similar service

## Conclusion

Email notifications are now fully integrated with the transaction polling system, providing a reliable backup mechanism to ensure users always receive booking confirmations, even if the primary webhook fails.
